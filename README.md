# ChatProgram
This chat program is not a normal chity chaty application that allows you to talk to your friends; ney, this program allows you to host your own chat server!

# How to use
1) Compile src/client/Client.java; this class is the main client program (GUI application)<br/>
2) Compile src/server/Server.java; this class is the main server program (hosts the server and manages connections)

# Features
More features are constantly being added, but here are a list of current features:
- Multiple clients connected to the same server.
- Client information (such as last used username and IP address) saved in a text file in the same directory as the client executable and automatically loaded at start.

# To do
- Add functionality to color code users.
- Add UUID's to users so that two different clients can connect to the same server with the same username but have seperate color codes.
